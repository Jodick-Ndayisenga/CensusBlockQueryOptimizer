# CensusBlockQueryOptimizer

CensusBlockQueryOptimizer is a Python-based project designed to generate a highly optimized list of search queries for scraping business data across the United States. The primary goal of this project is to reduce unnecessary queries while ensuring full coverage of all real businesses, enabling efficient and scalable data collection.

By leveraging U.S. Census Block data, this project applies advanced filtering techniques, dynamic zoom level adjustments, and multi-block optimization to bring the query count down from an unmanageable **42.5 billion** to a target range of **500 million to 1.2 billion queries**. This ensures maximum business coverage with minimal redundancy.

## Key Features
- **Census Block Filtering**: Removes non-business areas (e.g., forests, lakes, farmlands) to focus on urban, suburban, industrial, and rural commercial zones.
- **Dynamic Zoom Levels**: Automatically adjusts zoom levels (`z`) based on population density to balance accuracy and efficiency.
- **Industry Relevance Mapping**: Assigns only relevant industries to each block type, reducing irrelevant queries.
- **Multi-Block Optimization**: Merges adjacent blocks where possible to minimize redundant queries without double-counting businesses.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring the system can scale to meet future requirements.

## Use Cases
- Scraping business data for market analysis, location intelligence, or competitive research.
- Generating geospatial queries for mapping tools like Google Maps.
- Optimizing large-scale data collection pipelines for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Goals
1. **Efficiency**: Reduce the query count by over **99%** while maintaining full business coverage.
2. **Accuracy**: Ensure no businesses are missed in high-density urban areas or low-density rural regions.
3. **Scalability**: Build a modular pipeline that can handle larger datasets or additional industries as needed.
